# First Server App

* A fullstack (minus database) app for accessing a pre-selected list of streaming services that the user is theoretically signed up for.

* There is also a form so that the user can add additional streaming services that they have signed up for. 

* The idea is that the user can use this app to see, at a glance, what streaming services they're signed up for and the total amount they're spending per month on them (totals are not implemented yet!).
