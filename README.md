# First Server App

* A fullstack (minus database) app for accessing a pre-selected list of streaming services that the user is theoretically signed up for.

* There is also a form so that the user can add additional streaming services that they have signed up for. 

* The idea is that the user can use this app to keep track of what they're signed up for and the total amount they're spending per month on all their services.
